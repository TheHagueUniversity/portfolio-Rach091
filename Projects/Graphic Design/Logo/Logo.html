          The concept behind “warataruna cakrabuwana” comes from Sanskrit language , <br>which means youth as the driving force of the world. <br>That explains why both of my designs has a sillhoutte of a person.  </div></div>

          Pok-pok is the sound that chicken makes in my native language and bawel is the act of being annoyingly talkative. In the logo, I use bold colours such as red and yellow to make logo stands out more. </div></div>

          <div class="description4"><div class ="contentpastry">I design this logo for my friend’s business project that he had in his school.<br> He plans on selling cinnamon and apple flavoured danishes. <br>Hence, I decided to incorporate the main ingredient which is apple and cinnamon <br>in this logo. <br><br>

          The logo name “Seiko” comes from a Japanese language which means success <br>and the colours that I use are colours that goes well with <br>the natural shade of cinnamon and apple. </div></div>
