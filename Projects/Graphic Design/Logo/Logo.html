        <div class ="livicontent">This is also one of the logo that I made with my best friend to apply for a  competition. The winner’s logo will be picked as the main logo for my school’s science fair. 

        The theme behind the event is innovation through compassion. Hence I decided, to make the logo in a form of a rocket.

        <div class="lautitle"><strong>Laurensia Cup </strong>
            </div>

            <div class ="laucontent">This logo I designed together with my friends to apply for a competition. The competition is held for all students in my school and the winner’s logo will be picked as the main logo for the school’s anniversary event. We made 2 type of designs with a  different approach. 

            The concept behind “warataruna cakrabuwana” comes from Sanskrit language , which means youth as the driving force of the world. That explains why both of my designs has a sillhoutte of a person.  </div>

          <div class="chickentitle"><strong>Pok-pok Bawel</strong>
            </div>

          <div class ="contentchicken">I designed this logo for my mother’s and aunt’s new business. They plan to make a cafe in Bandung, Indonesia. The name of the business Pok-Pok Bawel. 

            Pok-pok is the sound that chicken makes in my native language and bawel is the act of being annoyingly talkative. In the logo, I use bold colours such as red and yellow to make logo stands out more.

          <div class="pastrytitle"><strong>Seikou</strong>
            </div>

            <div class ="contentpastry">I design this logo for my friend’s business project that he had in his school. He plans on selling cinnamon and apple flavoured danishes. Hence, I decided to incorporate the main ingredient which is apple and cinnamon in this logo. 

            The logo name “Seiko” comes from a Japanese language which means success and the colours that I use are colours that goes well with the natural shade of cinnamon and apple. </div>
