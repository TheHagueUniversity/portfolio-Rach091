      <h2 class="poster"><strong>Civics Poster </strong></h2>

      <p class="postercontent"><strong>I designed this poster for my school’s civics assignment. During that day, my country is celebrating Youth Pledge Day, which is a declaration made on 28 October 1928 by young Indonesian nationalists in the Second Youth Congress.
      Hence, I decided to make the poster in a form of an old newspaper featuring one of the most well known patriot. 

      Since it’s in a form of an old newspaper, most of the colours are in the shade of brown and black, to make it look vintage.  </strong>

        <p class="bookletcontent"><strong>I volunteered to design this booklet for an educational trip to Hong Kong, 3 years ago.  I choose bright colours that make it seemed fresh and playful. </strong>

        <p class="cardscontent"><strong>I designed  Eid Mubarak greeting cards for my mother’s company, so she could distribute packages for her co-workers. I used Eid colours which are mostly green and gold. </strong>
