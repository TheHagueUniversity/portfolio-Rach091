      <div class="poster"><strong>Civics Poster </strong>
            </div>

      <div class="postercontent"><strong>I designed this poster for my school’s civics assignment. During that day, my country is celebrating Youth Pledge Day, which is a declaration made on 28 October 1928 by young Indonesian nationalists in the Second Youth Congress.
      Hence, I decided to make the poster in a form of an old newspaper featuring one of the most well known patriot. 

      Since it’s in a form of an old newspaper, most of the colours are in the shade of brown and black, to make it look vintage.  </strong>
